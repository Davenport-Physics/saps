A rudimentary physics simulator
===============================


  Physics simulator is written in C for Unix-like operating systems, with the primary goal being to faciliate 
further understanding of both programming and physics. I am a undergraduate student majoring in physics who is passionate about programming, and I have been developing this application on and off for almost a year. I primarily focus on my studies
during the school year.

You'll notice that there isn't a lot of action happening visually, as my latest commits have been primarily focused on
making sure I'm programming the simulator as correctly as possible.
