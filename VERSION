Comments

I began writing this program during my freshmen year in college. At the time I
thought I knew enough C to write such an ambitious program. However it is now
two years later and I am finally releasing my first version of the program.

Version .1 is the program I wanted to write two years ago, and I'm very happy
that I finally finished it. 

Am I done working with SAPS? No, not at all. I have learned a lot about C
programming, and I wish to continue to learn. Therefore I will be developing
this application further when I have time. I am after all, still a college
student who is majoring in physics and not in computer programming.Therefore time is
very limited for me during the school year. However, instead of wasting my
time with computer games, I will now be replacing that hobby with developing
this application further.
